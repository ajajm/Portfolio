# Overview
This project is my personal portfolio website a single place that represents who I am, what I build, and how I think as a software engineer.
The goal wasn’t to impress with animations or frameworks stacked for no reason.
The goal was clarity, performance, and honesty.
If something exists here, it earns its place.

**Note:** This repository isn’t here to shout.
It’s here to stand.
If you’re reviewing this:
- Look at structure
- Look at decisions
- Look at what’s not here
That tells you more than any tech stack list ever will.
